- looked at grid.js for tables, but it does not seem to support edit features
- tabulator.info seems to support editing
- gonna go with an html table to get things off the ground

[11:30]
- theres a tradeoff between simplicity and focus of the exploration vs 
  how "built out" or complete it feels. I am going to go with simplicity
  and focus for now, and add things on as they feel needed. Concretely:
  I'm not going to make the table editable for now.
- ignoring responsiveness and em-based font-sizing for now

[12:00]
- I now have a plot and a table showing up

[1:30]
- I have a point dragging, continuous or discrete
- todo:
  - finesse discrete point drag animation
  - state sync with table
  - juxtapose multiple data
  - label axis, add legend
  - add "selection"
  - add "undo/redo"
  - clean up code, document, reflect

[2:00]
- I'm going to setup a data model so that I can have n points synced with n entries in the table

[3:00]
- I put aside discrete axis animation / interpolation for now. It should be a dynamics solution, not
    an easing curve solution, otherwise it will look jumpy.
  - was looking at https://easings.net/#easeInOutElastic
- I set up the data model. State sync is working.
- I need to make it possible to juxtapose multiple data models via color.
- I want to set up a plot model that has bidirectional binding to the data model; for best practice.
- I want to componentize the plot and table; for best practice.

- I need to fix the relationship between spatial coordinates and data values in the plot.
